# Pomodoro Timer

This project implements a classic Pomodoro Timer using React for the core logic and a separate HTML file for the basic structure and styling. It allows users to manage work sessions and breaks to enhance productivity.

**Features:**

* Customizable session and break lengths.
* Clear visual timer display.
* Start/pause and reset functionality.
* Audible alert for interval transitions.

The `Timer.js` file contains the React component with all the timer logic and state management using hooks. The `index.html` provides the foundational HTML structure and basic CSS styling for the timer interface.
